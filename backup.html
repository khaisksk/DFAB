    <p>This website is to inform you about what you will learn in this module and the contents of it. You can find a number of links here that can take you to the to useful pages. Be sure to browse and i hope you find what you are looking for! :D</p>
    
    <p>This module looks at equipping students with core knowledge and skills in digital fabrication, such as computer aided design, 2D/3D modelling, 3D printing, laser-cutting, electronics and embedded programming. These skills are developed through a range of hands-on, real-world activities. With the current CB measures in place, we will not be able to conduct hands-on 3D printing or laser-cutting sessions, but most of the other topics can still be conducted.</p>

    <h3><b>Week One:</b></h3>  
    <p>The first week was all about the introduction to the module itself. At the start of the first lesson, it was a little draggy as we were all trying to get used to Home Based Learning. Our teacher showed us and explained the functions of different applications that can be used to craft 3 Dimensional Models and creating our own website. It was very overwhelming to be fed so many information at one go, but the second lesson was slightly better.</p>
