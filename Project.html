    <h2><b>Documentation of Assignments:</b></h2>
    <h3><b>Week One:</b></h3>  
    
    <p>The first week was all about the introduction to the module itself. At the start of the first lesson, it was a little draggy as we were all trying to get used to Home Based Learning. Our teacher showed us and explained the functions of different applications that can be used to craft 3 Dimensional Models and creating our own website. It was very overwhelming to be fed so many information at one go, but the second lesson was slightly better.</p>
    
    <h3><b>Week Two:</b></h3>
    
     <p>For the second week was pretty much focused on website building. It was very interesting to learn about the different codes which served different functions. In my free time, i try my best to spruce up the website by searching for more codes online. In the same week, our teacher introduced to more applications to edit and draw pictures such as Gimp and Inkscape. </p>
     
     <h3><b>Week Three:</b></h3>
    
    <p>By the third week, our teacher had already instructed us to set up a Github account so that we could upload our html and css to a repository to get our website online. At first i was very confused with how to make use of the tools given by the website. I did a number of mistakes which resulted in a blank page instead of my website.</p>
    
    <p>We also got more hands on, on the application, Fusion360, which is the app my teacher shown before to produce our own 3 Dimensional models such as cubes, cones and spheres. Our teacher also got more in depth on the other applications (Gimp and Inkscape) where he demonstrated what it could do such as vector images, changing resolution, resizing and etc.</p>
    
     <h3><b>Week Four:</b></h3>
    
    <p>In week four, we learnt to make key chains and eggholder. During the lecture, he taught us step by step on what tools to use on Fusion360 to conjure up the different lines and shapes to form up the final product which is the keychain and the eggholder. During our individual lesson with our class, he instructed us to try it on our own. At first, of course it was confusing, what with all the numerous tools to work with. After a few minute. I got the hang of it and only managed to finish it after the lesson had ended.</p>
