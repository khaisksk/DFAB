<h2>Word Size Test:</h2>
<h2>First  Attempt:</h2>
<p>As for the group work, i am tasked with the word size test. When 3d printing words, symbols and etc, it is important to take note on the fine details, such as how big or small the word is. To understand the printing of such detail, a word size test can be done to see how fine and small words can be printed before the 3d printer is not able to print.</p>
<img src="word%20size%20fail.jpg" width="700" height="400">
<p>The picture above shows a model that i designed. The numbers 1-10 indicate the word size that they are set to. Modelling it, it seems perfectly fine and normal with the current word size. This is set to be 3d printed at 16 minutes.</p>
<img src="word%20size%20fail%201.jpeg" width="700" height="400">
<p>As you can observe here, the numbers 1-6 are not very clearly printed. Even when the numbers were more visible, the state of the word size model seemed untidy and incomplete. What we can deduce from this is that, printing smaller and finer word can be a hassle and troubling. I would not recommend to print any word below the size of 4 mm. The speed of the printer plays a part here too. Print too quickly, and the machine would not have enough time to model the word sizes accurately.</p>

<h2>Second Attempt:</h2>    
<img src="word%20size%20pass.jpg" width="700" height="400">
<p>In an attempt to achieve better results, remodeled the word size test and made it slight larger than its predecessor. The word size were from the 10 multiples of 2. This was set to be printed at 49 minutes.</p>
<img src="word%20size%20pass%201.jpeg" width="700" height="400">  
<p>As you can observe here, the test is more successful than the previous attempt. The numbers here are clearly shown and the print of the model seem to have no untidiness. This was also printed at a slightly different printing speed.</p>
    
<h2>Conclusion:</h2>
<p>In conclusion, whenever printing words or small symbols and engravings, one should always be wary of how small they want it to be as per the test, anything below 4-5mm may be less visible as compared to larger size. It may take longer, but the outcome of your product will surely be a fulfilling one.</p>
