     <h2><b>Holocron Force Light:</b></h2>

    <p>Credits: STAR WARS</p>
    <p>I am a huge fan of the Star Wars franchise, so i wanted to try and replicate the sith holocron! The concept of the replication would be to have it be activated by movement which would simulate "using the force" like in the franchise. </p>
    
    
    <h2>Original Concept:</h2>
    <img src="Original%20Concept.jpeg"  width="700" height="400">
    <p>This was the original concept that i came up with. As you can see on the left and righr, there are two different ideation. The one on the left is a design where i included hinges to allow the model to be opened and close freely. The hinges would be 3d printed and designed by me. The one on the right was a much more fixed design with no openable functions. For both of the designs, i chose to put the sensor at the bottom. The sides of the top triangle were to be covered by acrylic(Red), so that when the light radiates, the acrylic would help to give out the color.</p>
    
    <h2>Consultation:</h2>
    <p>After i  consulted with Mr Chew, he told me that a design without a hinger would be easier to execute. He also advised me to refrain from putting the sensor at the bottom of the model as it would defeat the purpose of being activated by movements, if  the sensor is facing the floor. He added that the bottom structure should be made of laser cut plywood instead of being 3D Printed.</p>
    
    <h2>Updated Concept:</h2>
    <img src="Updated%20Concept.jpeg"  width="700" height="400">
    <p>After the consultation, Mr Chew helped me to rework my design anf this is the final concept that i have decided to go with. The sensor is now shifted to the side of the box instead of undr the box. I also decided to opt for a cellophane paper to cover the sides instead of acrylic as it is easier to incorporate it into the model. After reviewing it, i began on my work.</p>
