    <h3><b>Week One:</b></h3>  
    <p>The first week was all about the introduction to the module itself. At the start of the first lesson, it was a little draggy as we were all trying to get used to Home Based Learning. Our teacher showed us and explained the functions of different applications that can be used to craft 3 Dimensional Models and creating our own website. It was very overwhelming to be fed so many information at one go, but the second lesson was slightly better.</p>
